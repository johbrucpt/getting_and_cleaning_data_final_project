## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the final project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course in the Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization on Coursera.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

## The data

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## The run_analysis.R Script

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

+ Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
+ Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
+ Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
+ Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
+ Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## The CodeBook.md 

The code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that were performed to clean up the data.
